# Mario AI

**Members:** Chanmi Oh, Oleksandr Litus, David Zheng
Why 3? â†’ While we hope to use reinforcement learning skills from class, we would like to delve deeper into neural networks. For example, evolutionary neural networks or neuroevolution (1, 2, 3). Higher number of people will give us flexibility to distribute work evenly when we try to implement more advanced techniques.


**Problem Statement:**
Develop an AI using reinforcement learning for Mario (better source, 1).
We want the AI to take in a game state and output the next best action from there, based on factors such as obstacles, enemies, and other environment elements. The basic goal of the algorithm should be to solve a Mario level, but we would also like to add additional goals later, such as score or time.

Outcome:
We develop an AI for Mario and learn how to optimize an AI for reinforcement learning. Ideally, our AI can finish level 1-1 and consistently win other levels with given time constraints. We would also consider how we can develop a generic algorithm that is adopted for the specific problem (mario). If time permits we would like to implement an evolutionary solution and compare the two approaches.

Algorithms:
Reinforcement learning (1), potentially if time permits evolutionary neural networks.
